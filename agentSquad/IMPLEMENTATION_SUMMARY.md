  - LLM API integration (Claude)
  - Message handling loop
  - Authority checking
  - COP access methods
  - Event logging

### Four Specialized Agents ✅

**Agent 1: Collection Processor** (`src/agents/collection_processor.py`)
- Processes sensor data and intelligence reports
- Validates detections (confidence > 0.5)
- Publishes processed intelligence
- **Authorities**: READ sensor data, WRITE processed intelligence
- **Cannot**: Modify COP, command drones, change plans

**Agent 2: Intelligence Analyst** (`src/agents/intelligence_analyst.py`)
- Analyzes processed intelligence
- Updates COP with entities (confidence > 0.7)
- Identifies coverage gaps
- Notifies Mission Planner
- **Authorities**: READ COP, WRITE COP entities
- **Cannot**: Command drones, create collection tasks

**Agent 3: Mission Planner** (`src/agents/mission_planner.py`)
- Creates and revises mission plans
- Responds to coverage assessments
- Assigns drones to missions
- **Authorities**: READ COP, WRITE plans, MODIFY plans
- **Cannot**: Command drones directly

**Agent 4: Collection Manager** (`src/agents/collection_manager.py`)
- Executes mission plans
- Creates collection tasks
- Issues drone commands
- Monitors drone status
- **Authorities**: READ all, WRITE tasks, COMMAND drones
- **Can**: Full drone command authority within mission parameters

### CLI Tools ✅
- `python -m src.cli show-cop` - View Common Operating Picture
- `python -m src.cli show-messages` - View agent message history
- `python -m src.cli show-events` - View event log

### Main Orchestrator ✅
- `main.py` - System initialization and test scenario
- Sets up initial COP state (3 drones, 2 entities)
- Runs test scenario from CLAUDE.md
- Manages agent lifecycle

### Sample Data ✅
- `data/drone_telemetry/uav_002_detection.json` - Trigger event
- `data/intel_reports/mission_brief_001.txt` - Intelligence briefing
- Additional telemetry files for UAV-001 and UAV-003

### Tests ✅
- `tests/test_context_manager.py` - COP operations
- `tests/test_authorities.py` - Permission enforcement
- `tests/test_message_bus.py` - Agent communication
- `tests/test_integration.py` - Full scenario test

## Test Scenario Flow

The implemented system demonstrates this autonomous coordination:

1. **Initial State**
   - UAV-001: Surveilling Area Alpha (34.05°N, 118.24°W)
   - UAV-002: Surveilling Area Bravo (34.08°N, 118.30°W)
   - UAV-003: In transit to Area Charlie
   - 2 known entities in COP

2. **Trigger Event**
   - UAV-002 detects high-value entity in Area Delta (34.10°N, 118.35°W)
   - Area Delta is currently NOT under surveillance

3. **Agent 1: Collection Processor**
   - Receives sensor data from UAV-002
   - Analyzes detection (mock tool)
   - Validates intelligence quality
   - Publishes processed intelligence to Intelligence Analyst

4. **Agent 2: Intelligence Analyst**
   - Receives processed intelligence
   - Evaluates significance (high-value target in uncovered area)
   - Adds new entity to COP
   - Identifies coverage gap in Area Delta
   - Notifies Mission Planner with coverage assessment

5. **Agent 3: Mission Planner**
   - Receives coverage assessment
   - Evaluates current mission plan
   - Determines UAV-003 can be redirected
   - Creates revised mission plan
   - Sends plan to Collection Manager

6. **Agent 4: Collection Manager**
   - Receives new mission plan
   - Checks UAV-003 status (fuel, position, capabilities)
   - Creates collection task for Area Delta surveillance
   - Issues navigate command to UAV-003
   - Updates COP with new task assignment

## Key Features Demonstrated

✅ **Autonomous Coordination** - No human in the loop
✅ **Authority Enforcement** - Role-based permissions work
✅ **Shared Context** - All agents read/write COP
✅ **Event-Driven** - Agents react to COP changes and messages
✅ **LLM Decision Making** - Each agent uses Claude for reasoning
✅ **Complete Audit Trail** - All actions logged
✅ **Observable** - CLI tools for inspection

## Running the System

```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Set API key
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY='your-key'

# Run the test scenario
python main.py

# Inspect results
python -m src.cli show-cop
python -m src.cli show-messages
python -m src.cli show-events

# Run tests
pytest tests/ -v
```

## System Output

When running, you'll see:
- Agent initialization logs
- LLM decision-making in action
- Message passing between agents
- COP updates
- Authority checks
- Final results after 30 seconds

Check the log file: `multi_agent_system.log`
Check the database: `cop.db`

## Architecture Highlights

- **Separation of Concerns**: Each agent has distinct responsibilities
- **Clear Authority Model**: Enforced at runtime with decorators
- **Async/Await**: All agents run concurrently
- **Transaction Safety**: COP updates are atomic
- **Type Hints**: Full type annotations throughout
- **Comprehensive Logging**: Structured logging with context
- **Testable**: Mock tools allow deterministic testing

## Next Steps

The system is fully functional and ready to demonstrate multi-agent coordination. Potential enhancements:

1. Add more sophisticated planning algorithms
2. Implement real-time streaming instead of batch processing
3. Add web UI for visualization
4. Integrate with real drone simulators
5. Add more agents (e.g., Threat Analyst, Resource Manager)
6. Implement distributed deployment
